# EVET's Cake Shop

## Design Choices
- **Color Scheme**: Soft pastel colors were chosen to create a warm and inviting atmosphere that reflects the sweetness of baked goods. The primary color palette includes light pinks and creams.
- **Layout**: The layout is designed for simplicity and ease of navigation. Key sections are easily accessible from the navigation bar, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Typography**: Clean and modern fonts were selected to enhance readability while maintaining a stylish appearance.

## Development Process
1. **Planning**: Outlined the structure of the website, including main sections and user flow.
2. **Design**: Created wireframes and selected color schemes and fonts.
3. **HTML Structure**: Developed the HTML layout for each page, ensuring semantic markup.
4. **CSS Styling**: Applied styles for responsive design and aesthetic appeal.
5. **JavaScript Functionality**: Implemented interactive features, including an image slider and form validation.
6. **Testing**: Conducted thorough testing to ensure functionality across different browsers and devices.
7. **Deployment**: Hosted the website on GitHub Pages for public access.

## Challenges Faced
- **Image Loading**: Initially, images were not loading properly due to incorrect paths. This was resolved by carefully verifying and organizing the image file structure.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Encountered issues with DOM manipulation during form handling, which required debugging and iterative testing to achieve the desired functionality.

## Interactivity
JavaScript was used extensively to enhance user interaction throughout the website. Key implementations include:
- **Image Slider**: The homepage features an automatic image slider that changes images every 3 seconds, showcasing different cakes.
- **Dynamic Blog Filtering**: Users can filter blog posts by category using JavaScript to dynamically update the displayed content without refreshing the page.
- **Form Handling**: The contact form includes validation to ensure all fields are filled out correctly before submission, enhancing user experience and data integrity.


## Conclusion
Through this project, I learned the importance of web design principles, responsive layouts, and user interactivity. The experience gained in using JavaScript for DOM manipulation and form handling has significantly improved my skills in web development.
